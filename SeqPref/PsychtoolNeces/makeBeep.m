function makeBeep(w,t)

%it was called function beep2(w,t) before Peggy Chen modified it
%
%plays a short tone as an audible cue
%
%USAGE:
%    beep2
%    beep2(w)    specify frequency (200-1,000 Hz)
%    beep2(w,t)     "       "       and duration in seconds

% play sound
% SOUND(wave,fs);
% however, SOUND command cannot play more than 200 beeps successively
% and an error message will show as below

% let's try psychtoolbox in order to play more than 200 beeps
% I need 1-10 beeps in a trial, and there are 225 trials in my experiment
